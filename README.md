# YOLOV5_Covid_Mask

#### This repo is basically for Custom object detection using YOLOV5.

#### As a custom dataset i have Mask images which i collected from Roboflow.

#### That dataset already contains annotations files so i dont need to redo the annotation part.

#### I have uploaded the custom dataset along with their annotation files in .txt format in google colab and i ran from there.
